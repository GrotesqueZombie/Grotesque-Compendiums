This module aims to help new players quickly engage with Ker Nethalas and Carnage & Aether almost right from the start on Foundry VTT. Thanks, Alex T, for the amazing games and for letting me upload these!

Now compatible with V13 and combined with KerNethalasCSB! Thank you, Forelius, for allowing me to include your original code and templates!
